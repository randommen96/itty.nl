It's becoming a tradition now I guess :-), another small list of projects I worked on the past year.

- Consolidated some [PowerDNS](https://www.powerdns.com/) based nameservers into one, to make administration easier;
- Migrated a Software VDOM link to NPU VDOM link with minimal downtime;
- Started working with [RIPE](https://www.ripe.net/);
- Enabled [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) in two Service provider networks;
- Built a Service provider network based on [Juniper](https://www.juniper.net/), [EVPN/VXLAN](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/research-topics/what-is-evpn-vxlan.html) with the super cool tool called Juniper [Apstra](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/product/us/en/apstra/);
- Built a huge Juniper [Virtual chassis](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/virtual-chassis-qfx/topics/concept/virtual-chassis-switches-overview.html) for a customer;
- Built a classic out-of-band network;
- Decommissioned a lot of legacy networks;
- Replaced live routers running in a virtual chassis with a VRRP set-up without downtime;
- Consolidated some [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/) firewalls into a [Fortigate](https://www.fortinet.com/products/next-generation-firewall);
- Written lots of [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) plays and improved older ones;
- Enabled IPv6 SSL-VPN and Nameservers;
- Implemented a couple of HA [MariaDB Galera clusters](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/galera-cluster/);
- Designed and built 8 new datacenter racks from scratch, while also switching from copper to fiber, keeping the cables neat;
- Worked with some great external partners;
- Paved the way for a good foundation to build a high available [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/) 6.4 cluster.
