Migrating from CentOS 7 can be a daunting task for businesses.

In this blog post, we'll discuss how ELevate helped us future-proof our systems by streamlining the migration process.

When benny Vasquez asked if I'd want to write a blog about our usage of ELevate, I started almost immediately and gladly took the opportunity!

Within Bizway BV we're almost wrapping up our Journey of updating all our and customer CentOS based systems, in which ELevate helped us out tremendously to future-proof our systems.

You can read the blog at the URL below, I tried my best to avoid creating a wiki within a blog and still have an interesting article to read!

P.S.If you're still looking for a way to migrate from CentOS 6, 7 or CentOS 8 Stream/Linux to for example AlmaLinux 8, look no further! :-)
