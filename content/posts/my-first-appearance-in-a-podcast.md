Last December I was invited by Niels Raijer from [Fusix Networks](https://www.fusix.nl/) to join their Fusix Podcast, last year I've been working closely with Fusix as there were some big Networking projects on the roadmap, which is a really nice experience.

Of course I gladly accepted the invite and couldn't wait to make my first appearance in a podcast! It can be heard here: [https://app.springcast.fm/18944/intent-based-networking-met-david-der-nederlanden](https://app.springcast.fm/18944/intent-based-networking-met-david-der-nederlanden)

We talked about replacing the whole network for a museum without any interruption and working with [Juniper Apstra](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products/network-automation/apstra.html).

We think it came together pretty well, if you have any feedback of further questions don't hesitate to contact me, I'll be glad to dive into it.
