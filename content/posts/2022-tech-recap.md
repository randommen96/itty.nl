A small list of projects I worked on the past year, these are the most interesting ones.

- Migrated ancient nameservers based on [PowerDNS](https://www.powerdns.com/) with a sturdy base of the latest [DNSDist](https://dnsdist.org/) and PowerDNS;
- Migrated a stack of VM's and their relevant IP space from one provider to another, between [Openstack](https://www.openstack.org/) and [Proxmox](https://proxmox.com/en/);
- Guided the migration of a older [Fortigate](https://www.fortinet.com/products/next-generation-firewall) cluster to a new one with minimal downtime;
- Started working with [OSPF](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First);
- Built a good backup solution on top of [Proxmox Backup Server](https://proxmox.com/en/proxmox-backup-server/overview);
- Created an automated and standardized deployment with [Cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx).
- Updated lots of Proxmox and [Ceph](https://ceph.io/en/) clusters.
