This year was a busy year with bigger long running projects, which take quite a toll but are in the end very rewarding. In a small list the following activities are the most notable:

- Consolidated 3 datacenters, consisting of 10 racks into 2 datacenters with 8 racks, doing so decommisioning older servers and rebuilding the entire network infrastructure, transistioning from traditional copper to fully fiber, standardized on Singlemode, fully multihomed, built with Juniper Apstra;
- Upgraded two PowerDNS nameservers to up-to-date versions;
- Upgraded multiple Proxmox clusters from 6.x to 8.x;
- Upgraded multiple Ceph clusters from Nautilus to Reef;
- Upgraded Zabbix 6.4 to 7.0 LTS;
- Gave multiple presentations and trainings about networking and Proxmox;
- Attended CloudFest and Cephalocon which sparked my interest and got me more involved in opensource communities and trying to bring my relevant input.
